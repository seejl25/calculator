# calculator
Calcualtor project from TheOdinProject

Project Requirements:
1. display can only output 2 numbers and 1 operator each time (i.e <firstNum> <operator> <secondNum>)
2. if "=" is pressed before 2 numbers and 1 operator is pressed, error will occur
3. using two operators consecutively will also give error
4. divide by 0 will give error
5. after 2 numbers and 1 operator are pressed, if another operator is pressed, the calculator will evaluate the first 2 numbers and operator first. After getting the output, the display will then show the output and the second operator (for e.g if 3 + 2 is keyed in first, then user clicks on + again, the calculator will display 5 +)
6. when result is displayed, if a number is pressed, the display will reset with the new number
7. "AC" button allows user to reset display and "Del" button allows user to undo their input
8. Keyboard events for the calculator

**used flexbox instead of grid for this calculator
